This project is about the world population

India and China dominate the global population 🌏
Combined, they make up 35% of the total world population, more than Population distribution is highly concentrated.
Top 20 countries account for 70% of the world’s total population. 🏆
This means that ~200 other countries/territories share the remaining 30%.
Sharp drop-off after the top two 📉
The third most populous country (United States, ~340M) has only one-fourth the population of India or China.
South & East Asia are the population hubs 🌐
India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand all appear in the top group, Asia clearly dominates global demographics.
Pareto principle in action 📈
A small fraction of countries (top ~10%) contribute the majority of the global population — classic 80/20-like pattern.

Conclusion 🎯
This high concentration means that population-related policies, resources, and economic changes in these few countries will have an outsized global impact.

Bangladesh leads in crowding – Highest density (1,329 people/sq. km) despite being smaller in total population than several others.
India vs. China – Similar population size, but India’s density (481) is over 3× higher than China’s (152), reflecting land area differences.
Low-density giants – Russia (9), Brazil (26), and the US (37) have vast land areas that spread their populations thin.
Moderate middle – Countries like Indonesia (153) and Mexico (66) balance large populations with manageable densities.

Conclusion:
Population size alone doesn’t reveal the full story—density highlights the real pressure on land, infrastructure, and resources, showing why smaller but crowded nations face bigger day-to-day challenges than some larger, sparsely populated countries.
